## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how **AI can be applied in manufacturing** to predict machine failures before they occur.  
It includes an end-to-end pipeline with **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and a Streamlit dashboard frontend.**  

**Business Value:** Predictive maintenance helps reduce unplanned downtime, lower maintenance costs, and improve production efficiency.
